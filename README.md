# Voiceit
Voiceit allows users to interact with banking services with voice commands. <br />
In addition to making it easy for physically challenged users to use the banking applications easily, it also gives that cool "Jarvis" handsfree factor to the user experience.

## How It works

1. Download and Install the app <br />
2. Register with your account <br />
3. Give command and get response <br /><br/>

## Developer
 1. Clone the repo <br />
 2. Build the android apk in the app folder
 3. The services_java folder contains the api hosted on http://voiceit.mybluemix.net
 

## Extensibility plans
Currently the app is only able to check account balance. But it will eventually do virtually all bank app services. Also it could serve as a Call Center assistance to handle voice call enquiry and complaints.
